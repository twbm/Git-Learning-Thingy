This directory is for storing my course projects.

I have another one called 'Projects', but that one is way too unorganised
so i just decided to make a new one!

The course i am talking about is one where i learn python.
I bought it on Udemy.
It is structured in 100 days, each having a project/exercise/new thing to learn.

Currently, i am at day 26 because i made large improvements to the project that they were teaching us,
and that took quite a long time.

Since it's a python course, there are a lot of project with python files, but i will also have .txt files,
.csv files, .jpg and .gif images, etc.

Every project will have a proper name, but if i do nothing special in that day then the name will be 'day-<number>'.
